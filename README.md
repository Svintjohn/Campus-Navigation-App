The Campus Navigation App (CNA) is application designed to help students,
faculty, and visitors efficiently navigate university campuses. It provides real-time
directions, location-based services, and contextual information about buildings,
departments, events, and facilities. Built using object-oriented programming (OOP)
principles, the system ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability—ideal
for deployment across diverse academic environments.
• Helps students find buildings, events, and services on campus.
• Uses inheritance for map elements and encapsulation for route logic
